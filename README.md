# Companies hiring remote
This repo is meant to be a list of companies that hire security people full remote.  The original list that this was forked from is still maintained can be found at https://github.com/jaegeral/companies-hiring-security-remote

## Motivation

As reported in articles like [this](https://fortune.com/education/articles/the-cybersecurity-industry-is-short-3-4-million-workers-thats-good-news-for-cyber-wages/), there continues to be a huge gap in security talent.  A reason for this is the shortage of remote-work positions. The more talent gap there is, the more the talented people can choose positions, so promoting remote friendly positions / teams is a way to attract people.

## Contributing

You can help that list by creating issues or creating merge requests.

## Quality Gate

Some companies promote remote talents, some other don't but are not against it.  Companies are okay to be listed if one or the other is true (listing a source is prefered!)

Remote is meant to allow people from anywhere (or at least anywhere in a given timezone) without being forced to be in an office on a daily base.

## FAQ

Q: Company XYZ is listed but does not offer a remote job at the moment - why is it listed?

A: We try very hard to keep the list up-to-date as possible, so at the time of adding a organisation, that organisation either offered a remote security job or had a public statement, that they are remote friendly. But as time goes on, organisations might not have (remote) positions open or even change the approach to remote friendly envirenment.

Q: Company XYZ is not listed, but is remote friendly, can we add it?

A: Sure, either make a pull request or raise an issue or tell me via twitter

Q: Is that page also available as webpage?

A:  Yup! The original poster published https://jaegeral.github.io/companies-hiring-security-remote/
